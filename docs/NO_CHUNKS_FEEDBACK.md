# No-Chunks Feedback Improvements

This document describes the improvements made to KnowAI's feedback system when no text chunks are extracted for a query in a file.

## Overview

When users ask questions about their documents, KnowAI searches through the document chunks to find relevant information. Previously, when no chunks were found for a file, the feedback was generic. Now, the system provides much clearer and more specific feedback about why no information was found.

## Improvements Made

### 1. Enhanced Default Messages

**Before:**
```
No relevant information found in 'report.pdf' for this question.
```

**After:**
```
No relevant information found in 'report.pdf' for this question. The search did not retrieve any document chunks that match your query.
```

### 2. Improved Individual File Processing

**Before:**
```
No relevant documents found in 'report.pdf' to answer the question.
```

**After:**
```
No relevant documents found in 'report.pdf' to answer the question. The search did not retrieve any document chunks that match your query.
```

### 3. Better Tracking in Synthesis

**Before:**
```
No info in: `report.pdf`.
```

**After:**
```
No matching content found in: `report.pdf` (no matching content).
```

### 4. Enhanced Prompt Instructions

The synthesis prompts now include explicit instructions to:
- "clearly state this in your response" for no matching content
- "clearly state which files had no relevant content"
- Distinguish between different types of missing information

### 5. Improved Raw Document Formatting

**Before:**
```
--- No Content Extracted for File: report.pdf ---
```

**After:**
```
--- No Content Extracted for File: report.pdf (no matching document chunks found) ---
```

## Technical Implementation

### Files Modified

1. **`knowai/agent.py`**:
   - Enhanced default messages in `generate_individual_answers_node`
   - Improved tracking in `combine_answers_node`
   - Better formatting in `format_raw_documents_for_synthesis_node`

2. **`knowai/prompts.py`**:
   - Updated synthesis prompts to provide better guidance
   - Enhanced instructions for handling missing content

3. **`scripts/test_no_chunks_feedback.py`**:
   - New test script to demonstrate improvements
   - Comprehensive testing of all enhancement areas

### Key Functions

- `generate_individual_answers_node`: Provides specific feedback for each file
- `combine_answers_node`: Tracks and reports files with no information
- `format_raw_documents_for_synthesis_node`: Formats raw documents with clear messaging
- Synthesis prompts: Guide the LLM to clearly state missing content

## User Experience Benefits

### 1. Clear Understanding
Users now understand exactly why no information was found in specific files.

### 2. Better Decision Making
With clearer feedback, users can:
- Adjust their search queries
- Select different files
- Understand the scope of available information

### 3. Reduced Confusion
No more generic "no information found" messages that don't explain the search process.

### 4. Improved Trust
Users can see that the system actually searched the files and provides specific feedback about the search results.

## Example User Interaction

**User Question:** "What are the climate change impacts mentioned in the reports?"

**System Response:**
```
I found information about climate change impacts in the following reports:

From report1.pdf (Page 15):
"Global temperatures have increased by 1.1Â°C since pre-industrial times..."

From report2.pdf (Page 8):
"Sea level rise is accelerating at a rate of 3.3mm per year..."

No matching content found in: report3.pdf (no matching content).
```

This response clearly shows:
- Which files contained relevant information
- The specific content found
- Which file had no matching content
- Why no content was found (no matching chunks)

## Testing

Run the test script to see the improvements in action:

```bash
python scripts/test_no_chunks_feedback.py
```

This will demonstrate:
- Enhanced default messages
- Improved tracking mechanisms
- Better synthesis prompts
- More descriptive error handling

## Future Enhancements

Potential future improvements could include:
- Providing suggestions for alternative search terms
- Showing which parts of the search process failed
- Offering to search with different parameters
- Providing metadata about the search process (e.g., number of chunks searched)

## Conclusion

These improvements significantly enhance the user experience by providing clear, specific feedback about why no information was found in certain files. Users now have a much better understanding of the search process and can make informed decisions about how to proceed with their queries.
